The task runner utilises **Babel** for its ES2015 to JavaScript conversion, **Gulp** for it's build tasks and **Karma**, **Chai** and **PhantomJS** for unit testing.

## Getting Started
Node and npm are both required to use to build the app.
To install simply clone the repo and fetch all required packages using the following command.
```
npm install
```

## Usage
To preprocess all code and create a releasable `/public` folder use
```
gulp
```
When **developing** use
```
gulp dev
```

## Development

When using `gulp dev`, the task runner will create a **BrowserSync** session which will serve the `/public` folder to all connections on your network.

### Gulp
All build tasks can be found in the the `/gulp/tasks` directory.

The standard `gulp` task can be found in `/gulp/tasks/default.js`.

The development `gulp dev` task can be found in `/gulp/tasks/dev.js`.

The tasks are powered by the `/gulp/config.js` file and the majority of project structure changes should be made here.

### JavaScript

#### Structure
The JavaScript is structured as *pages*, *modules* and *data* and collated using **Browserify**.

You should try to structure JavaScript files based on whether they are page specific (therefore should be in the relevant file in `/source/js/page` folder) otherwise as a *module*.

The entry point is in `/source/js/main.js` and is present on every page. Each page should be required and initialised based on whether the body's class. eg.

```javascript
new Page();

```
These page JavaScript objects should then require any required modules as well as any static data needed.

The overall call stack should look like this...

```
+-- main.js
    |
    +-- page/page.js
        |
        +-- components/component.js
```

#### External Files
All installed external JS files (such as jQuery or D3) should be installed via npm or placed in the `/source/js/vendor` folder. The location to the required input file should be added to `/gulp/config.js`.

### SASS

#### Structure
The SASS file structure contains *mixins*, *pages* and *components*.

The entry point is `/source/scss/main.scss` and is present on every page. No CSS should be written in this file and should be only used to include *mixins* and *pages*.

Each *page* should have a parent selector of the page name set as the body class. The page SASS file should include unique styling only found on this page and include any common *component* or extend any *mixin* needed.

All variables should be stored in `/source/scss/_vars.scss`.

All common fonts or typography styling should be set in `/source/scss/_typography.scss`.

When adding new fonts make sure they are added to the `/source/fonts` folder or if using npm, ensure their file path is stored in the `/gulp/config.js` file.

#### External
All external non SASS files should be referenced in `/gulp/config.js`, otherwise it can be included in `/source/scss/main.scss`.

## Test

The test framework used is **Mocha** with **Chai**, while the browser used as default is **PhantomJS**.

All test data should be stored in `/tests/data`.

All tests should be written in the `/tests/unit` folder.

### Usage

To start the Karma test runner in a PhantomJS session
```
npm test
```
